# Scratchpad:
#
    # Sway has a "scratchpad", which is a bag of holding for windows.
    # You can send windows there and get them back later.

    # Move the currently focused window to the scratchpad
    # bindsym $mod+Shift+minus move scratchpad

    # Show the next scratchpad window or hide the focused scratchpad window.
    # If there are multiple scratchpad windows, this command cycles through them.
    # bindsym $mod+minus scratchpad show

# Read `man 5 sway-bar` for more information about this section.

#    position top

    # When the status_command prints a new line to stdout, swaybar updates.
    # The default just shows the current date and time.
